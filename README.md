# Speed-Swing-Script
Saber Showdown swing attack speed increaser

# Issues
If you found any in the script, please report them in Issues.

# Common bugs
1. When turned off, the script make your swings even slower and delayed (I'm currently trying to fix that).

# Features
1. Computers or cellphones with a keyboard connected on it can turn the script ON and OFF by pressing "C" key (C key is registered on the saber thrower keybind, you must remove this keybind or replace it with another one).

more coming soon... idk
