# Speed-Swing-Script
Saber Showdown swing attack speed increaser

# Issues
If you found any in the script, please report them in Issues.

# Common bugs
1. When turned off, the script make your swings even slower and delayed

# Features
1. Computers or cellphones with a keyboard connected on it can turn the script ON and OFF by pressing "C" key (C key is registered on the saber thrower keybind, you must remove this keybind or replace it with another one).

# Updates
# Lakiz V3
Changes:
1. Fixed Mid-Air swing cancel (may still occur if the entered speed is low);

2. Now the Swing speed is defined by the literal value entered, and not by multiplication, so now the default value that already comes in the text box is "80";

3. Improved the stability of the swings, now they are more fluid, being easier to hit;

4. No visual changes.

more coming soon... idk
